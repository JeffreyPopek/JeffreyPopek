<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Jeffrey 👋</h1>

I'm a recent graduate from Champlain College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Game Programming. My fascination with making games started back in high school when I took my first game programming class. Even though I didn't have much technical know-how, my love for video games inspired me to learn more. This journey led me to Champlain College, where I'm chasing my dream of creating games.
